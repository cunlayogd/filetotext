FileToText
=============
This is a Composer installer adaptation of the "PHP DOC DOCX PDF to Text: Convert DOCX, DOC, PDF to plain text" class coded by Aditya Sarkar and available here:

http://www.phpclasses.org/package/8908-PHP-Convert-DOCX-DOC-PDF-to-plain-text.html

In your composer.json, add:

    {
        "require": {
            "wholehogsoftware/filetotext": "dev-master"
        }
    }

You can then install the package with Composer and autoload as necessary.
